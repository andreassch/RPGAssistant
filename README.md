# RPGAssistant: the role playing game master's assistance tool

This is a small tool to assist a role playing game master. It contains the following modules:

* Turn order list: Manage turn order and NPCs during combat.
* NPC Generator: Randomly generate non-player characters from different region, race, etc.
* Calendar: A calendar with moon phases and holidays, taylored to the system The Dark Eye.
  As the calendar computations are separated from the GUI, it can easily be adapted to other systems.
* more modules to come ...

## Compilation

You can also configure and compile on the command line with the following steps:
